## Insights from our Analysis

| Insights                                |
|---------------------------------------|
|**1- Post-COVID Recovery**: Some transportation modes (e.g., subway or bus) likely recovered faster than others like LIRR or Metro-North. Normalized plots probably show Subway rebounding sooner due to higher dependencein urban areas.  |
| **2- Weekend vs Weekday Trends**: Ridership patterns may differ significantly between weekdays and weekends. Recommendations might include adjusting service frequency or staffing based on observed usage. Weekend ridership is lower across all modes. Transit demand is highest on weekdays, suggesting potential for off-peak scheduling savings.|
|**3- Seasonal or Temporal Trends**: Monthly or yearly breakdowns could reveal seasonal drops (e.g., holidays) or long-term recovery trends |
|**4- Total Ridership Trends**: Identification of overall rising or falling ridership trends post-2020. Important for capacity planning and infrastructure investments. |
|**5- Forecasting**: If ARIMA was applied to total_ridership, the model may project future demand, helping in planning service levels.       |
|**6- Mode Recovery Trends**: From normalized ridership trends: Subways and buses likely showed faster recovery post-COVID. Commuter rails (LIRR, Metro-North) lagged‚Äîlikely due to ongoing hybrid/remote work reducing daily suburban commutes.|
|**7- Total Ridership Rebound**: Total ridership shows a gradual upward trend, which is a strong signal of recovery. Fluctuations may align with seasonal patterns or COVID variant surges. |

## Recommendations You Could Derive

| Recommendations                                |
|---------------------------------------|
|**1- Resource Allocation**:Increase service where recovery is strongest (e.g., subways on weekdays), reduce frequency for underused services.|
|**2- Targeted Marketing**: Promote LIRR or Metro-North through pricing or service incentives to stimulate slower-recovering ridership.|
|**3- Policy Interventions**: Consider flexible schedules or hybrid work policies to distribute peak demand more evenly. |
|**4- Forecast-Driven Planning**: Identification of overall rising or falling ridership trends post-2020. Important for capacity planning and infrastructure investments. |

##  Conclusion

This project provided a comprehensive analysis of MTA daily ridership trends from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic through the recovery phase. By examining patterns across various transit modes‚Äîincluding subways, buses, LIRR, Metro-North, and paratransit services‚Äîwe identified how different parts of the transportation system were impacted and how they are rebounding over time.

## Key Takeaways

- Subways and buses experienced the steepest initial drop but also demonstrated the strongest recovery, especially on weekdays.

- Commuter rail services like LIRR and Metro-North have shown slower ridership recovery, indicating potential overcapacity or changes in commuter behavior (e.g., remote work).

- Ridership varies significantly by day of the week and season, with weekdays and fall months seeing higher usage.

- Forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA) suggest that full ridership recovery is ongoing but uneven across modes.

- Cost considerations reveal that buses and subways remain the most cost-effective transit options, whereas commuter rail and paratransit services are more expensive per rider.

## Recommendations

- Prioritize service adjustments and investments in subway and bus systems, where rider recovery is strongest.

- Reevaluate the frequency and scale of commuter rail services to align with changing demand patterns.

- Implement targeted outreach and marketing for underutilized services.

- Use forecasting outputs to guide staffing, budgeting, and maintenance planning.

- Integrate these findings into a dashboard for ongoing monitoring, decision-making, and stakeholder communication.
