## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze MTA daily ridership data to identify trends in subway, bus, and commuter rail usage. The goal is to:

- Assess ridership recovery post-pandemic  
- Understand peak travel times  
- Explore factors affecting transit usage  

**Data Source**: MTA Open Data (aggregated from MetroCard/OMNY tap-ins and automated counters)  
**Data File**: [📂 MTA Daily Ridership Data](https://github.com/sarahh-emadd/Daily_Ridership/blob/main/data/MTA_Daily_Ridership.csv)

## 📌 Objectives

- Identify peak ridership hours for different modes  
- Analyze subway, bus, and rail ridership over time  
- Compare current ridership to pre-pandemic levels  
- Evaluate external factors (COVID-19, weather, economy)  
- Provide actionable insights for planning & policy

## 🔍 Project Scope

- Data collection and cleaning from MTA records  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations  
- Trend identification and forecasting using ML  
- Develop interactive dashboards for insights
