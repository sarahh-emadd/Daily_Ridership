## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze MTA daily ridership data to identify trends in subway, bus, and commuter rail usage. The goal is to:

- Assess ridership recovery post-pandemic  
- Understand peak travel times  
- Explore factors affecting transit usage  

**Data Source**: MTA Open Data (aggregated from MetroCard/OMNY tap-ins and automated counters)  
- **Data File**: [📂 MTA Daily Ridership Data](https://github.com/sarahh-emadd/Daily_Ridership/blob/main/data/MTA_Daily_Ridership.csv)
-  **Data Dictionary**: [📂 MTA Daily Ridership Data](https://github.com/sarahh-emadd/Daily_Ridership/blob/main/data/MTA_data_dictionary.csv)

## 📌 Objectives

- Identify peak ridership hours for different modes  
- Analyze subway, bus, and rail ridership over time  
- Compare current ridership to pre-pandemic levels  
- Evaluate external factors (COVID-19, weather, economy)  
- Provide actionable insights for planning & policy

## 🔍 Project Scope

- Data collection and cleaning from MTA records  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations  
- Trend identification and forecasting using ML  
- Develop interactive dashboards for insights

## Insights from our Analysis

| Insights                                |
|---------------------------------------|
|**1- Post-COVID Recovery**: Some transportation modes (e.g., subway or bus) likely recovered faster than others like LIRR or Metro-North. Normalized plots probably show Subway rebounding sooner due to higher dependencein urban areas.  |
| **2- Weekend vs Weekday Trends**: Ridership patterns may differ significantly between weekdays and weekends. Recommendations might include adjusting service frequency or staffing based on observed usage. Weekend ridership is lower across all modes. Transit demand is highest on weekdays, suggesting potential for off-peak scheduling savings.|
|**3- Seasonal or Temporal Trends**: Monthly or yearly breakdowns could reveal seasonal drops (e.g., holidays) or long-term recovery trends |
|**4- Total Ridership Trends**: Identification of overall rising or falling ridership trends post-2020. Important for capacity planning and infrastructure investments. |
|**5- Forecasting**: If ARIMA was applied to total_ridership, the model may project future demand, helping in planning service levels.       |
|**6- Mode Recovery Trends**: From normalized ridership trends: Subways and buses likely showed faster recovery post-COVID. Commuter rails (LIRR, Metro-North) lagged—likely due to ongoing hybrid/remote work reducing daily suburban commutes.|
|**7- Total Ridership Rebound**: Total ridership shows a gradual upward trend, which is a strong signal of recovery. Fluctuations may align with seasonal patterns or COVID variant surges. |

## Recommendations You Could Derive

| Recommendations                                |
|---------------------------------------|
|**1- Resource Allocation**:Increase service where recovery is strongest (e.g., subways on weekdays), reduce frequency for underused services.|
|**2- Targeted Marketing**: Promote LIRR or Metro-North through pricing or service incentives to stimulate slower-recovering ridership.|
|**3- Policy Interventions**: Consider flexible schedules or hybrid work policies to distribute peak demand more evenly. |
|**4- Forecast-Driven Planning**: Identification of overall rising or falling ridership trends post-2020. Important for capacity planning and infrastructure investments. |
